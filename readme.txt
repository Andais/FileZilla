Errors may occur when transmitting files using FileZilla. I modified the source code of FileZilla to give it a self-checking and self-correction mechanism against transmittion errors. Specifically, I generated the signature of the local file and the remote file. And after finishing the transmission, I will compare the local signature with the remote signature. If the two signatures match, then the work is done. Otherwise, FileZilla will retransmit the file.
